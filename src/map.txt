room$bedroom$This room is a richly-furnished bedroom, with Victorian-era paintings on the wall. It looks like it used to be very fancy, but now everything is covered in a layer of dust. There are spots on the wall where paintings used to hang, and the remains of a broken urn on the nightstand. The door is made of metal and has a wheel in the center, like something you would see on a ship or submarine.
room$hallway$This hallway connects several rooms in the house. It looks to be in poor repair, with peeling wallpaper and a painting hanging askew on the wall. A window at the end of the hall is boarded up, and you can hear the wind whistling through the cracks in the boards. There is a small metal lever next to the eastern door, and the western door has a shiny brass lock.
room$room$This looks like an old storage room, piled high with empty crates. The air in here is musty and stale, and you can see mouse droppings on the floor.
room$kid's room$This room looks like a child's room, with a small bed and old toys scattered about. There are cobwebs everywhere, it's obvious nobody has been in here for a very long time. A cracked picture frame shows a little girl in a puffy dress, but she isn't smiling.
room$staircase$A wide staircase that connects the first and second floors of the house. The fancy red carpet is rotting away and the handrail is missing.
room$foyer$A large foyer at the front of the house. The huge windows are boarded up with sturdy barricades, and an imposing painting of a severe-looking woman looms over the room. The front door is made of a strange material with strange symbols on it.
room$outside$Outside of the house, if you've made it this far then you've won! REMEMBER TO CHANGE THIS TEXT LATER!!!
room$living room$This looks to be an old living room, home to family gatherings and parties. The only gatherings here now are between the mice and the spiders. There is a stone fireplace here that looks like its been used recently. There are pieces of several broken idol statues on the floor, depicting all manner of gods and goddesses.
room$dining room$This is a dining room, crowded by a large wooden table in the middle of the floor. The table still has plates and silverware set for a fancy dinner, covered in cobwebs. Once this place had held wine and laughter, but no longer. Over the door to the kitchen reads an inscription: 'Poor people have it. Rich people need it. If you eat it you die. What is it?'
room$kitchen$This looks to be an old kitchen, with a cast-iron oven, large countertops, and many cabinets with broken doors. The bittersweet stench of death is overpowering here, emanating from the rotting human corpse stuffed haphazardly into the oven. The corpse is bloated and disgusting, and your nostrils scream for you to leave this room.

storytext$0$You slowly open your eyes and awaken in an unfamiliar place. You try to remember how you got here, what happened last night, but you have trouble even remembering your own name. You feel an overwhelming sense of dread, you must escape this place.
storytext$1$Why would my door be locked from the inside? Who or what was it meant to keep out? As you walk into the hallway, you observe the bizarre surroundings and your heart drops in your chest. Locked doors and contraptions, what is this limbo of puzzles?
storytext$2$A mouse scurries away as the door creaks open on rusty hinges. The musty and stale air in this room causes you to cough and spit, echoing loudly in the small space. The stark silence in the old house when you stop coughing sends chills up your spine.
storytext$3$As you enter the child's room you hear a faint humming. It resonates deeply in your head and your chest, and draws you towards a pile of children's toys towards the back of the room. A toy stands out among the scattered dolls and rattles: a metal statue of a winged god. You find yourself attracted to it's power as the low humming swells in your chest.
storytext$4$The stairs creak with your weight, and the entire house seems to waver and shake. A bat squeaks and narrowly misses your head, flying away across the foyer and deeper into the house. The shadows seem to shift at the edges of your vision, making you feel they are dangerous. The sooner you leave this place, the better.
storytext$5$The large room looks to be looted, with just a few broken chairs and a 3-legged table propped up in the corner. The large painting dominates the room, something in the woman's cold eyes making your skin crawl. It seems obvious to you why no thief would take it. You can see outside through the front door, but you feel an odd sensation as you draw closer to it. You cannot tell if it is made of wood or metal, and it looks perfectly smooth. When you look at the strange markings you feel an overwhelming urge to look away. You know this door is the way out of this horrible place, but it holds more questions than answers...
storytext$6$WIN GAME, ROLL CREDITS   :) good job!
storytext$7$As you walk into the room, you hear a crunch underfoot as you step on something: A broken statue of a god with outstretched arms. This room looks like the graveyard of the gods, the final resting place of conquered deities.
storytext$8$You hear the sound of movement from the next room! You can feel the blood rushing in your ears as you strain to focus on the soft scuffle you can hear moving across the floor in the kitchen. Then... nothing... it stops and the house seems quieter than it's ever had since you arrived.
storytext$9$The door flies open and you see a ghostly apparition, a spectral man with a terrified look on his face. He is looking right at you in horror, with his arms raised in defense. You can hear a faint echo of a voice pleading for mercy as he backs away. He lets out a terrible shriek and makes a dash for the large oven, disappearing in a puff of unearthly mist. As the apparition fades, it reveals a cadaver stuffed into the oven at a gruesome angle. It looks the man was overpowered by something much bigger and stronger, and it tossed him around like a ragdoll. A staggering sense of danger washes over you, holding your heart in a cold grip.
